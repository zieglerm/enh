For fear of running through my "lifetime creation limit of 10 projects" in a month, this is a place for me to keep small projects while I work out whether they're going anywhere, or to inter those that I've given up on.

You might want to go straight to the source and start poking around, but I do try to keep track of stuff I'm working on:

Android:
  * [Dalvik Explorer](DalvikExplorer.md)
  * [Ics Bot](IcsBot.md)
  * [Mathdroid](Mathdroid.md)

Linux:
  * LittleHelper
  * [mp3d](mp3d.md)

I also keep [project ideas](ProjectIdeas.md) and a [graveyard](Graveyard.md) of moribund projects here.
