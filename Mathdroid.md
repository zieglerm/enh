#### How do I get Mathdroid? ####
If you just want to use Mathdroid, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Mathdroid".

It's a free download. Old versions (and the current version if you don't have Market access) are [available here](http://code.google.com/p/enh/downloads/list).

#### How do I use Mathdroid once I've got it? ####
Hopefully that's obvious when you run it. If not, there's built-in help. If you need more help, please tell me what you need to know more about.

#### How do I report a bug/provide general feedback? ####

If you want to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.
