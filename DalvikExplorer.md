#### How do I get Dalvik Explorer? ####
If you just want to use Dalvik Explorer, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Dalvik Explorer" (<a href='market://details?id=org.jessies.dalvikexplorer'>direct link</a>).

It's a free download. Old versions (and the current version if you don't have Market access) are [available here](http://code.google.com/p/enh/downloads/list).

#### How do I report a bug/provide general feedback? ####
Click on the "Issues" tab above and then click on "New issue". Or follow this direct link: [report a bug](http://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/entry).

If you want to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.

#### Where's the source code? ####
If you came here for the source code, click on the "Source" tab above and follow the instructions.

#### Future Enhancements ####

The file system viewer should show information equivalent to "ls -l". Also MIME type. Also menu option to send ACTION\_VIEW intent before viewing as text in built-in FileViewerActivity. (Maybe automatic, based on guessed MIME type?)

Add a character viewer? So you'd type 202a or whatever and get to see U+202a, plus maybe the result of all the methods in Character applied to that code point?

Don't even try to view files that are > 1/2 our heap size? hexdump view?

Write summary to sd card rather than trying to mail (since the summary is so large, mail tends to choke)?

Built-in benchmarks?

Network interfaces?

Crypto stuff?
